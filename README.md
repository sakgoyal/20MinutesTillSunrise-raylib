# 20 Minutes till Sunrise

## Still WIP (Currently creating assets and coding game logic)

This game is a rouglike styled game where the player is in a dungeon and has to fight enemies. The game gets progressively harder and harder and has to survive for 20 minutes. After that time ends, the night ends and the sun comes back at which point the next day starts.

During the day, the player can upgrade their stats and weapon loadout and then progress to the next night.

## Building
